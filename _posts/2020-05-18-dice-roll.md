# Dice roll animation

Just a quick post today as I had been playing with some ideas for the dice roll animation. In keeping with the flat 2D approach to the game I had a good hunt around for ways in which the dice could be animated within the game. Styling a simple dice is very straight forward using a simple border and small border radius...
```
<div class="die">1</div>

```

```
.die {
  text-align: center;
	border: solid 1px limegreen;
	border-radius: 3px;
	color: limegreen;
	display: inline-block;
	line-height: 50px;
	font-size: 1.2rem;
	width: 50px;
	height: 50px;
}
```
but the tricky part is how to animate this? Up until now the game has been based on picking a random number from the dice array to apply as the score but as I need to animate through the faces of the dice before ending up on the score it is maybe better to randomise the dice array, loop through the values and the last value then becomes the score. 

To test this out I started with a standard 6 sided dice...
```
var die = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
```
I then created a function which will show the first item in the die array and remove it using the shift() method...
```
function rollDice(diceNumbers) {
  $('.die').text(diceNumbers.shift());
}
```
which can then be looped on a timer so each number is displayed for a short time before the function calls itself again. This can be repeated until there is only one number remaining...
```
if (diceNumbers.length) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    rollDice(diceNumbers);
  }, 200)
}
```

Add in a simple sort function to randomise the die array and iterate through each of the numbers to still get a random result each time...
```
function rollDice(diceNumbers) {
  diceNumbers.sort(function() { return 0.5 - Math.random() });
  $('.die').text(diceNumbers.shift());
  if (diceNumbers.length) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      rollDice(diceNumbers);
    }, 200)
  }
}
```

I then added the button to trigger the dice roll. Sending the die array to the rollDice() function using the .slice() option creates a copy of die without affecting the original so it can be shuffled, sliced and diced without affecting it for the next roll...
```
$('.diceRollBtn').click( function() {
  rollDice(die.slice());
});
```
That loops through all of the faces nicely so now to give it a "rolling" effect by using a simple css transformation. As I want the dice face to "roll" through 360&deg; and there are 6 faces to my dice I can set up my keyframe animation in 60&deg; steps. As the animation has to be timed in percentages I can do some rounding to smooth out the 16.6667% which will not be noticeable as the animation will be running quite quickly...
```
@keyframes roller {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  16% { transform: rotate(60deg); }
  33% { transform: rotate(120deg); }
	48% { transform: rotate(180deg); }
	66% { transform: rotate(240deg); }
	83% { transform: rotate(300deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```
Because I want animation to run only once and I want to be able to repeat the animation the simplest way to implement this would be by adding (and removing) a class to trigger the animation..
```
.roll {
	animation: 1.2s 1 forwards roller;
}

```
which can be added when the dice roll button is clicked...
```
$('.die').addClass('roll');
```
and removed again with a simple timeout function once the animation has finished...
```
$('.diceRollBtn').click( function() {
  $('.die').addClass('roll');
  rollDice(die.slice());
  setTimeout(function() {
     $('.die').removeClass('roll');
    }, 1200);
});

```
